# Pokemon_battleGame
This project is a Pokemon battle game using JavaScript. It defines two classes, "Pokemon" and "Game", which represent the properties and actions of a pokemon and the game state, respectively.

The Pokemon class holds information about a pokemon's name, health, and attack abilities, as well as methods for attacking another pokemon. The Game class manages the game state, including determining if the game is over and who the winner is.

The code also includes several functions, such as the updateGame function, which updates the display of the game on the webpage, and the play function, which calls the updateGame function. There are also event handlers for buttons on the webpage, such as the reset button and attack buttons, that allow the user to interact with the game and perform actions like resetting the game or attacking their opponent.
